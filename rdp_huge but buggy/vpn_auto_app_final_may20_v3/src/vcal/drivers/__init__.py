# /home/ubuntu/vpn_auto_app/src/vcal/drivers/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'drivers' directory a Python package.
# Specific driver modules (e.g., forticlient_driver.py) will be placed here.

# You can optionally import specific drivers here to make them available
# when the package is imported, or rely on dynamic discovery in VPNManager.

# Example (if you had a FortiClientDriver class in forticlient_driver.py):
# from .forticlient_driver import FortiClientDriver

print("VCAL drivers package initialized.")
